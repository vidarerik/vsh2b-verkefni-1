				<p>But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. </p>

					"David Icke makes his First Live Appearance in Iceland, a country that in David's very own words "Doesn't take Sh*t" and that's something to be internationally celebrated. David's Full 12 Hour show that takes the Audience on a Journey from the World they see today (Terrorism, Media Bias, Illuminati, Secret Society's) right through to the Nature of Reality and Who We Really Are and What We Are..."

					"David's Live Events are something truely unique, so many people wonder how one man can speak for 12 hours, and hold an audience, the hardest thing for David is keeping the event to that time, with the mountain of information he has uncovered during his 26 years of research into these topics these events  could span an entire week."

					"These events act as a simple step by step guide that leads the Audience from A to B to C and beyond, and leaves the audience at the end of the day with knowledge, understanding and explanations you'll find no where else."

					"What's all the hype about? Come and Find Out on Sunday 26th March..." </p>

		<p>On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and </p>
